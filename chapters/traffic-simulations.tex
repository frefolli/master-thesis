\chapter{Traffic Simulations}

\section{SUMO}

SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) is an open source multi-modal, microscopic traffic simulator developed by the Institute of Transportation Systems at the German Aerospace Center. It accept a network description file ($*.net.xml$), a demand and flows description file ($*.rou.xml$). It comes with several utils which enable the user to construct or edit a network or a simulation, generate demand from OD matrices, verify correctness of description files, dump slices of OpenStreetMap and more.

\paragraph{Network}

% Explain options as well
% Edges
% Lanes
% Intersections
% Traffic Lights (and programs)

\paragraph{Flows}

% Explain options as well
% Vehicles
% Routes
% TAZ

\paragraph{Flexibility}

% Explain general sumo-wide options
% Acceleration model
% Entering delays
% Lane change granularity
% Usage of junctions as TAZ
% Simulation step
% Deadlocks and recover (--ignore-junction-blocker)

\section{Traffic lights as agents}

% Traffic light is an agent
% Changing to other phases is its action
% Its phase is its state
% Incoming vehicles and lanes are its observation

\section{SUMO + RL}

% Enabling device for simulation with traffic light agents
% Blends reinforcement learning into agents
% Gather metrics from vehicles and lanes in order
% Plots metrics
% Generates flows
% Executes simulations
